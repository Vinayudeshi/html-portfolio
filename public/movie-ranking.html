<h1>The Best Movies According to Vinay</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movie recomendations would be:</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>This is something that I have never watched but would love to see.</p>

<h3>Shall We Dance.</h3>
<p> I saw this movie a month ago, and I just loved it that 
    watched once again with my Girlfriend. It's about a 
    man who has everything in life, but still feels as if 
    there is a void that needs to be filled. <br/>
    On his commute back and forth from and to the office, daily
    he looks at a women who is standing on the window of a shop
    that is titled to be teaching Ball Room Dancing. And I 
    would love to do the entire summary but I'm short on time 
    so bye bye.

<h3>Spider Man ( The latest one ) </h3>
<p>THis was a good movie as well but i've fergotten what 
    it was all about. I guess in order to remember things 
    I need to note them down and think about them once again 
    after i am done consuming the content.
